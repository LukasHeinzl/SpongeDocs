Custom Command Registrars
=========================

.. javadoc-import::
    org.spongepowered.api.command.registrar.CommandRegistrar

.. warning::

    Most plugin developers do not need to create their own :javadoc:`CommandRegistrar`. If you are using a non-Sponge
    native command framework, refer to their documentation on how to build and register your command. If you simply want
    to write commands for Sponge, see :doc:`our pages on parameterized comamnds instead<parameterized/index>`.

Stuff goes here.
