=========================
Custom Command Registrars
=========================

.. warn::

    Most plugin developers do not need to create their own :javadoc:`CommandRegistrar`. If you are using a non-Sponge
    native command framework, refer to their documentation on how to build and register your command. If you simply want
    to write commands for Sponge, see :doc:`parameterized/index <our pages on parameterized comamnds instead>`.

Stuff goes here.
