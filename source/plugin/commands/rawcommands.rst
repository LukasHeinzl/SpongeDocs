====================
Writing Raw Commands
====================

.. note::

	While Sponge provides the ability for you to control the string parsing yourself, it is recommended that you use 
    :doc:`parameterized/index <the parameterized commands instead>`, so that client completions are supported with
    minimal effort from you. 

.. tip::

    :javadocs:`Commands.Raw` replaces API 7's ``CommandCallable``.

Raw commands are simple. Ish.
